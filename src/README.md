## Contact Lists

Create a menu-driven program to emulate a Contact Lists Application. 
You might see such apps in smartphones, you are free to go ahead and take ideas
from your own contact applications.  

Your menu-driven program must look like: 
```
Welcome to DBC's Contact List App
Press 1 to add a new contact
Press 2 to view all contacts
Press 3 to search for a contact
Press 4 to delete a contact
Press 5 to exit program 
```

The 'Add a new contact menu'
```
You have chosen to add a new contact: 
Please enter the name of the Person
First Name: Divyansh
